# 100DaysOfMLCode

Day 1: Refresher on Python. Following the Kaggle Learn Python exercises. It is estimated to take 7 hours but given that I already know Python I figure it should take much less time. #100DaysOfMLCode

Day 2: More refresher on Python. Continuing with Kaggle Learn. Yesterday was a good reminder of Python syntax. Today I plan on finishing all Python basics and move onto the real ML tomorrow!

Day 3: Jumping on the Machine Learning track on Kaggle Learn! Built a simple model with Pandas!
