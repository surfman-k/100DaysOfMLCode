# Here's the takeaway: Models can suffer from either:

# Overfitting: capturing spurious patterns that won't recur in the future, leading to less accurate predictions, or
# Underfitting: failing to capture relevant patterns, again leading to less accurate predictions.
# We use validation data, which isn't used in model training, to measure a candidate model's accuracy. This lets us try many candidate models and keep the best one.
