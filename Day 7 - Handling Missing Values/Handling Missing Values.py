# Python libraries represent missing numbers as nan which is short for "not a number". You can detect which cells have missing values, and then count how many there are in each column with the command:

missing_val_count_by_column = (data.isnull().sum())
print(missing_val_count_by_column[missing_val_count_by_column > 0

# Most libraries (including scikit-learn) will give you an error if you try to build a model using data with missing values. So you'll need to choose one of the strategies below.



# If your data is in a DataFrame called original_data, you can drop columns with missing values. One way to do that is

data_without_missing_values = original_data.dropna(axis=1)
# In many cases, you'll have both a training dataset and a test dataset. You will want to drop the same columns in both DataFrames. In that case, you would write

cols_with_missing = [col for col in original_data.columns 
                                 if original_data[col].isnull().any()]
redued_original_data = original_data.drop(cols_with_missing, axis=1)
reduced_test_data = test_data.drop(cols_with_missing, axis=1)
# If those columns had useful information (in the places that were not missing), your model loses access to this information when the column is dropped. Also, if your test data has missing values in places where your training data did not, this will result in an error.

# So, it's somewhat usually not the best solution. However, it can be useful when most values in a column are missing.


# A Better Option: ImputationÂ¶
# Imputation fills in the missing value with some number. The imputed value won't be exactly right in most cases, but it usually gives more accurate models than dropping the column entirely.

# This is done with

from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
my_imputer = SimpleImputer()
data_with_imputed_values = my_imputer.fit_transform(original_data)

# The default behavior fills in the mean value for imputation. Statisticians have researched more complex strategies, but those complex strategies typically give no benefit once you plug the results into sophisticated machine learning models.
# One (of many) nice things about Imputation is that it can be included in a scikit-learn Pipeline. Pipelines simplify model building, model validation and model deployment.




# Imputation is the standard approach, and it usually works well. However, imputed values may by systematically above or below their actual values (which weren't collected in the dataset). Or rows with missing values may be unique in some other way. In that case, your model would make better predictions by considering which values were originally missing. Here's how it might look:

# make copy to avoid changing original data (when Imputing)
new_data = original_data.copy()

# make new columns indicating what will be imputed
cols_with_missing = (col for col in new_data.columns 
                                 if new_data[col].isnull().any())
for col in cols_with_missing:
    new_data[col + '_was_missing'] = new_data[col].isnull()

# Imputation
my_imputer = SimpleImputer()
new_data = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.fit_transform(new_data))
new_data.columns = original_data.columns

# In some cases this approach will meaningfully improve results. In other cases, it doesn't help at all.
